# Imported Data from Nautobot Folder

This folder will contain JSON files (e.g., `nautobot_vms_20231010_121212.json`) with VM data from Nautobot 
when debug mode is enabled, including:

- VM names, statuses, custom fields, clusters, and network interfaces.

These files help verify data fetched from Nautobot when `--debug` is used.
